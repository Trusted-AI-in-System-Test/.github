# The Trusted AI in System Test Research Project

This GitHub organisation is the home for source code and other resources for a research project at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) investigating the uses of AI in managing the System Test process.

System testing tools typically create and run a large number of candidate tests, using a heuristic or search-based process, which is both valuable but can lead to a number of challenges in terms of managing the testing process and the results.  This project is investigating ways in which AI can help to reduce the costs on the development team while maintaining the strong defect finding power of the system testing process.
